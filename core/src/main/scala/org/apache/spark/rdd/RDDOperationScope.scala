/**
 * A general, named code block representing an operation that instantiates RDDs.
 * 指定代码块代表操作实例化RDDS
 * All RDDs instantiated in the corresponding code block will store a pointer to this object.
 * Examples include, but will not be limited to, existing RDD operations, such as textFile,
 * reduceByKey, and treeAggregate.
 *所有的RDDS实例化对应的代码块将存储一个指向该对象,例如包括,不限于现有RDD操作,如文本文件,
 * An operation scope may be nested in other scopes. For instance, a SQL query may enclose
 * scopes associated with the public RDD APIs it uses under the hood.
 * 操作范围可以嵌套在其他作用域中,例如,SQL查询可以用公共RDD API使用的相关范围
 * There is no particular relationship between an operation scope and a stage or a job.
 * A scope may live inside one stage (e.g. map) or span across multiple jobs (e.g. take).
